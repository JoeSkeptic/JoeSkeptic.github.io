👋 Hi, I’m @JoeSkeptic
👀 I’m interested in outdoors, hiking, travel, coding. I like to tinker, and I want to build websites, link directories, android/Apple apps, tools I can use. I want to build side projects and monetize them. I want to make money using affiliate adds on blogs and sell stuff I create or buy wholesale. I need to learn webmarketing, and I'm going to have to figure out social traffic at some point.
🌱 I’m currently learning The Odin Project, and BS CS at Eastern New Mexico University
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects
